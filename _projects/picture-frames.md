		Making picture frames using a mitered half lap joint.
		<br>
		<p>
			This joint is much stronger than a normal miter and, I think,  looks better than a normal half lap.  I had four 16x20 prints done using some images from NASA.  
			The frames are made from solid cherry left over from my <a href="/videos/credenza">credenza project</a>.  I just used scraps of what I had for backers for the prints.  
			Two of them were made from foam board, the other two from some wainscoting left over. The prints were glued using spray adhesive.  I was going to use glass fronts, but gave up after breaking a few pieces.

			The frames were sealed with two coats of shellac.
