        Making picture frames using a mitered half-lap joint.
        <br>
        <p>
            This joint is much stronger than a normal miter and, I think, looks better than a normal half-lap.  I had four 16x20 prints done using some images from NASA.  
            The frames are made from solid cherry left over from my <a href="/videos/credenza">credenza project</a>.  I just used scraps of what I had for backers for 
            the prints.  Two of them were made from foam board, the other two from some wainscoting left over. The prints were glued using spray adhesive.  
            I was going to use glass fronts, but gave up after breaking a few pieces.
            <br>
            The frames were sealed with two coats of shellac.

            I started off milling the boards and cutting them to size.
            Once the boards are to size, I started with the short ends and cut a half-lap joint into 
            each end with the table saw.  I do not have a dado blade, so I did this in multiple passes with a single blade.
            <img  src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shots_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            After the half-laps were done, I moved over to the miter saw and cut 45&deg; off of the ends.
            This finishes up the short sides.

        </p>
        <p>
            Now I move over to work on the long sides.  
            I use the miter guage on my table saw with the blade set to the same height as for the earlier half-laps.
            On one end per board, I cut out a 45&deg; half-lap in the long pieces up until I get to the 45&deg; line from the corner of the board to the length of the half-lap.
            <img  src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shots_3.png" />
            Then I flip the miter guage and do the same to the opposite end.

        </p>
        <p>
            Once this is done, they go together like this.

            <img  src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shots_6.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Glue them up, sand and finish.  I sanded to 220 grit and finished with Shellac,
            thinned down with a bit of denatured alchohol, sanding between coats with 220.
