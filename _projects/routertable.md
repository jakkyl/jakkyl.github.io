			I just wanted a basic router table to fill in the gap on my 36-725 table saw.  The router table is 2x2 pine joined with bridle joints and the center is MDF.  
			The fence was based off of one from Popular Mechanics and made from scrap 1/2" cherry plywood, 
			the fence face is from 3/4" cherry plywood left over from my <a href="/videos/credenza">credenza project</a>.
