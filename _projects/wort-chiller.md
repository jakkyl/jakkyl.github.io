			Making a quick recirculating immersion wort chiller to cool the wort after the boil during a brew day.
			<br>
			The first time I used it, it took about an hour to get down to 100F from boiling.  
			The second time I used it, I would shake the copper inside the pot up and down every few minutes to mix up the wort and distribute the heat.  That brought the temps down to 100F in 30 minutes, 150F in about 4 minutes.  
			The next time I will replace the water after it gets down to about 150 or so; both times I just kept the same water in the cooler, but I think if I were to get replace the hot water in the cooler with cold water, 
			then add ice, that will bring the temps down even quicker.
