        </section>

        <p>I started by cutting 3/4" cherry plywood down to size, then cut the ends at 45&deg; on the table saw.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_1.jpg" />

        <p>I cut dados for the door to slide in and the divider to sit in.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_2.jpg" />
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_3.jpg" />

        <p>I then drilled holes for the shelf pins.  I did this before gluing the shell together so it's easier and more accurate.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_4.jpg" />

        <p>
            Gluing it up, I used ratchet straps to keep everything tight.  I put small blocks behind the actual ratcheting part to prevent marring the surface; I should
            have also put something around the corners, as there was a little deformation on some of the corners where the straps tightened.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_5.jpg" />

        <p>After the glue dried, I measured and cut the back panel out of 1/2" cherry plywood.  You could attach the back during glue-up, but I prefer after.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_6.jpg" />

        <p>With the back glued in, I measured and cut for the vertical divider and installed that.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_7.jpg" />

        <p>
            I then moved on to the legs.  Cut from 4/4 rough cherry, I hand planed one side flat and then passed them through my electric planer to get the other side
            flat and to the correct thickness.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_8.jpg" />
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_9.jpg" />

        <p>
            I used a scrap piece of plywood to make a template for the legs and transferred that to all the pieces.  I made an effort to find pieces with the straightest
            grain to use for the legs.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_10.jpg" />

        <p>I cut out the pieces using my table saw and cross-cut sled.  I found using the template scraps (not the actual template) to position the work piece helped with the cut.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_11.jpg" />

        <p>Clamping the legs to the template, I sanded all the legs flush on my belt/disc sander.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_12.jpg" />

        <p>I then cut the stretchers that connect the legs together and cut half-laps in both the stretchers and legs to join them.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_13.jpg" />
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_14.jpg" />

        <p>
            I cut the curved bit left over from the tablesaw with a hand saw, then I glued up both sets of legs and clamped them together,
            putting tape between them to keep them from sticking to each other.
        </p>

        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_16.jpg" />

        <p>I then cut down another cherry board for edge banding on the exposed plywood edges.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_17.jpg" />

        <p>After the edge banding has been planed, it's then glued and clamped to the plywood edges.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_18.jpg" />

        <p>I cut them over sized to start and then flush cut them once the glue had dried.  Then sanded and planed them flush.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_19.jpg" />
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_20.jpg" />

        <p>I made the door handle by just cutting a square piece of cherry and rounding the edges over on my belt sander.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_21.jpg" />

        <p>It was attached to the back with two screws, the holes were predrilled.</p>
        <img src="{{ page.picturePath }}/process-shot_22.jpg" />

        <p>Last step is finishing with shellac.  I thinned the shellac down with a bit of denatured alcohol.</p>
